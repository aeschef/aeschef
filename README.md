I am Anna Scheffrahn, a computer science student at The University of Texas at Austin. 

I believe that many real world problems have technological solutions and that by working effectively with people solutions can be reached. 
am currently working on a project for a healthcare provider to efficiently give feedback to patients after their appointments.
